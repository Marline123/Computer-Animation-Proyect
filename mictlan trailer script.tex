\intslug[day]{Teotihuacan}

Quetzalcoatl is waiting nervously at the center of a reunion place waiting for his brothers and other gods to arrive

\begin{dialogue}[walks and see the sky with preocupation]{Quetzalcoatl}

\end{dialogue}

A group of gods arrive, and as they take sit on any rock, one of them approaches to Quetzalcoatl

\begin{dialogue}{Xipetotec}
So, why did you call all of us in here, brother?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Quetzalcoatl}
I kept thinking about what we talk last time, and
\end{dialogue}

Abruptly Xipetotec shuts up Quetzalcoatl

\begin{dialogue}{Xipetotec}
I already told you that you can't create again a humanity, they only makes us do catastrophes and all life perish
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Quetzalcoatl}
But, just listen to me, I have a great idea, only give me the chance
\end{dialogue}

Xipetotec sight, and start walking to take a seat in order to listen to Quetzalcoat speech


\begin{dialogue}[continuing]{Quetzalcoatl}
I know that the past humanities were a failure, but, I've been thinking, and I found a solution , we need to combine the best characteristics and fix the mistakes of the past humans so the new ones would be perfect, but to do that, I need to know what went wrong with them, I need you to tell me.
\end{dialogue}

All of the presents start murmuring and begin to refuse to answer Quetzalcoatls peticion

\begin{dialogue}{some random god}
Even if we tell you, you can't just repeat exactly the ancients, they're gone, and nothing of them remains
\end{dialogue}

Quetzalcoatl felt discourage, so Xipototec stood up and walk toward Quetzalcoatl

\begin{dialogue}{Xipetotec}
I'm sorry brother, maybe it coukd have worked, but it's impossible
\end{dialogue}

Tezcatlipoca stood up and start talking

\begin{dialogue}[mocking tone]{Tezcatlipoca}
HEY! Do I need you all to remember that there are still remainings of all YOUR failures deep in Mictlan? 
\end{dialogue}


\begin{dialogue}{Quetzalcoatl}
Yeah! that's right, Mictlantecuhtli, You should know were the bones are, can you give them to me?
\end{dialogue}


\begin{dialogue}[angry]{Mictlantecuhtli}
I absolutly refuse to give you the bones, that's a bad idea, unifying the ancients will cause a worst destruction, and not only for the land, they are going to suffer more 
\end{dialogue}


\begin{dialogue}{Quetzalcoatl}
You can't know that unless we try it. 
\end{dialogue}

Tezcatlipoca approaches to Quetzalcoatl
\begin{dialogue}{Tezcatlipoca}
You know brother, you can just only search them yourself
\end{dialogue}

Mictlantecuhtli stood up aggressivily
\begin{dialogue}[angry]{Mictlantecuhtli}
Don't you dare to do it, if so, you'll not be well received in my domains!
\end{dialogue}

Mictlantecuhtli dissappears in a smoke cloud
